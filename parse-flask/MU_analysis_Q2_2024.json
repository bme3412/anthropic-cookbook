  "summary": "Micron Technology reported strong financial performance for fiscal Q2 2024, with total revenue reaching $5.8 billion, a 23% increase sequentially and a 58% increase year-over-year. The company achieved a gross margin of 20%, driven primarily by improved pricing, and returned to profitability ahead of expectations. Strategic initiatives include a focus on high-value solutions and maintaining a stable bit share, with a particular emphasis on data center products and high-capacity DIMMs. Market conditions have improved significantly, contributing to a favorable supply-demand balance, and Micron anticipates positive free cash flow for the second half of fiscal 2024, projecting record revenue in fiscal 2025. Notably, the company is seeing strong customer demand for its 128GB products, which are expected to generate several hundred million dollars in revenue this fiscal year. However, the company did not provide specific details on prepayments, indicating potential uncertainty in that area, and highlighted risks related to market demand fluctuations and pricing trends.",

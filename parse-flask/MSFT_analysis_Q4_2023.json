Earnings per share rose to $2.69, reflecting a 21% increase. The Microsoft Cloud surpassed $110 billion in annual revenue, growing 27% in constant currency, with Azure accounting for over 50% of this total for the first time. Strategic initiatives focused on enhancing cloud and AI infrastructure are progressing well, with a strong emphasis on operational excellence and customer value. Market conditions remain favorable, with healthy renewal strength in commercial business and a growing demand for AI solutions. Notable updates include the introduction of new pricing for Copilot, which is expected to expand the total addressable market significantly.

Key Points Dividend ETFs are an excellent way for investors to generate income through investments without taking an active approach to trading. Among dozens of dividend ETFs available, investors can find funds targeting specific metrics like dividend yield, growth, and more. SCHD, VYM, and VIG are three popular dividend ETFs focused on large-cap U.S. stocks and with a strong history of performance. 5 stocks we like better than Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF . Dividend stocks offer multiple benefits for retail investors: in addition to providing a steady stream of passive income which can be reinvested to boost portfolio performance, dividends are usually a signal that a company has strong stability. Companies focused on growth—or struggling to manage one or more elements of their business operations—are typically not in a position to pay money out to investors in the form of dividends. When selecting a dividend stock, investors often look to factors including dividend yield and payout ratio or to a history of boosting dividend payouts as indicators of a winning choice. Still, even the most established dividend-paying firms can sometimes face unexpected turmoil or otherwise have reason to reduce or eliminate payouts. As is often the case in equities investing, targeting a broader group of dividend stocks can help to minimize this risk, as well as overall performance risk. Dividend stock ETFs are an excellent way to generate income over time. Get SCHD alerts: Sign Up SCHD: All-Around Dividend Stock Strength Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF Today SCHD Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF $28.15 -0.18 (-0.64%) (As of 10/25/2024 ET) 52-Week Range $22.22 ▼ $28.90 Dividend Yield 9.09% Assets Under Management $63.11 billion Add to Watchlist The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF NYSEARCA: SCHD is a well-rounded and competitively priced dividend ETF. It targets a portfolio of around 100 large-cap U.S. firms that are selected based on their long history of paying dividends. The fund also factors in elements including yield and dividend growth, helping to ensure that companies included in the portfolio have fundamentals to support continued dividend strength going forward. SCHD\'s top holdings include dividend stalwarts like Cisco NASDAQ: CSCO and Home Depot Inc. NYSE: HD . With more than $63 billion in assets under management and a one-month average trading volume of about 11 million, SCHD is liquid and unlikely to cause investors to incur unexpected trading fees, making it ideal for more active traders. Additionally, the basket is not overweighted toward a small number of top stocks but reaches a limit of around 4.4% allocation for any individual company, ensuring it is broadly diversified. Ad Weiss Ratings Nvidia is Pivoting to Solve Big Tech’s $1 Trillion Problem Taiwan Semiconductor, a partner of Nvidia’s for more than two decades, has seen its shares explode as much as 4,744%. Now, if you’re like everybody else, you want to know what Nvidia’s doing next … and who they’re going to partner with … Find out details on these three critical Nvidia partners immediately. VYM: Diversification and Value Stocks Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF Today VYM Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF $128.43 -1.05 (-0.81%) (As of 10/25/2024 ET) 52-Week Range $98.40 ▼ $131.85 Dividend Yield 2.53% Assets Under Management $59.67 billion Add to Watchlist Like SCHD, the Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index ETF NYSEARCA: VYM also focuses on large-cap U.S. stocks, but its approach is distinguished by the size of its portfolio and its emphasis on dividend yield. VYM has more than five times as many holdings as SCHD, with over 500 stocks in its portfolio. These firms are selected based on dividend yield and value characteristics. Large-cap, dividend-paying value companies are often seen as highly stable, making VYM an excellent choice for a diversified dividend ETF for buy-and-hold investors. Its diversification is also a standout characteristic, making this fund even more attractive for investors looking for steady passive income. VIG: Growth Stocks With Dividend Increase History Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF Today VIG Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF $196.89 -1.03 (-0.52%) (As of 10/25/2024 ET) 52-Week Range $149.67 ▼ $201.85 Dividend Yield 1.51% Assets Under Management $86.17 billion Add to Watchlist Another large-cap U.S. fund, the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF NYSEARCA: VIG , has a slightly different focus from VYM above. Rather than target stocks with an appealing value proposition, VIG seeks firms with the potential for future growth. Another key consideration for selection in VIG\'s portfolio is dividend payout growth. To be included, a company must have a history of at least 10 consecutive years of annual dividend increases. VIG\'s portfolio of about 340 stocks is also widely diversified, although not quite as broad as VYM above. A couple of heavy-hitting tech stocks— Apple Inc. NASDAQ: AAPL and Broadcom Inc. NASDAQ: AVGO —are slightly more heavily weighted but still come in at under 5% of total assets. An Array of Dividend ETFs There are dozens of dividend stock ETFs currently available, giving investors no shortage of options. These funds offer a surprising array of different strategies, from broad-based approaches like SCHD above to a highly specialized focus on a single metric (such as dividend yield). They also differ in portfolio makeup, including multiple market capitalization categories, geographic specializations, and more. The three ETFs above all share an expense ratio of 0.06%. While this is not the lowest fee across the dividend ETF space, it is highly competitive. Further, they all enjoy strong asset bases and performance histories, making each a good general dividend ETF. Investors looking for a niche dividend ETF product may wish to explore the space further, though they should be prepared to pay more for a targeted fund. → The real reason Elon is fully endorsing Trump (From Porter & Company) (Ad) Should you invest $1,000 in Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF right now?

In any case, it’s up for debate as to whether Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) deserves its spot in the cohort.

The newest Mag 7 member may be the most magnificent of them all It’s tough to outdo the performance of Nvidia stock, especially as it looks to set the stage for a breakout to new all-time highs ahead of its latest Blackwell chip launch. That said, just because NVDA stock is heating up again doesn’t mean we should give AVGO shares any less love as it enjoys an explosive expansion of its own. With numerous catalysts on the horizon and a still-modest 29.15 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple, perhaps there’s more to love about AVGO stock than meets the eye. In September, William Blair analyst Sebastien Naji started AVGO with a buy rating, citing “continued growth into fiscal 2025 and 2026 driven by increasing custom chip demand” and “improved software monetization.” Custom AI chip opportunity is a significant growth driver. Undoubtedly, there seems to be a rush to custom AI chips, with many mega-cap tech titans looking to take a more active role in designing their hardware and lowering their dependence on third-party GPU makers. As more firms look to double down on custom (ASIC) chips in the coming years, Broadcom stands out as a key beneficiary. Of course, GPU demand isn’t about to fade in favor of ASIC chips anytime soon, especially as firms embrace nuclear energy to power their next-generation AI data centers. Either way, custom chips could play a growing part in running the most sophisticated AI models in the not-so-distant future, especially as more firms value efficiency and customization at the hardware level. Over the next four to five years, JP Morgan ( NYSE:JPM ) sees Broadcom eying a $150 billion market opportunity in custom chips. Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOG ) Google’s tensor processing unit (TPU) chips are just one of the potential significant sales growth drivers for Broadcom over the coming years, especially if more tech titans — like Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) — become more open to considering the Nvidia alternatives out there. The software business could also be a big boon. It’s not just AI chips where Broadcom can shine. With VMWare’s recent transition to the subscription model, Broadcom has a chance to improve the monetization of its software business — something Mr. Naji brought up in his recent bullish note — while positioning itself for a longer-term expansion. All considered, AVGO stock has the hardware and software drivers in place to perhaps close off the year as one of the Mag 7’s best performers. At today’s modest price of admission, perhaps it makes sense to favor the name as it looks to join the $1+ trillion club.

Aneena Alex Stocks Oct 26, 2024 Share As Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) prepares for its third-quarter earnings release on October 31, market expectations are rising. With Amazon’s stock price relatively flat over the past quarter at a current level of $187, investors are wondering if this upcoming report could serve as a catalyst for renewed momentum. While macroeconomic challenges are pressuring Amazon’s core retail business, its strengths in cloud computing and advertising remain focal points, likely playing a key role in its Q3 results and providing potential for a stock surge. Amazon six-month stock price. Source: Finbold AWS’s stronghold in the cloud market Amazon Web Services (AWS) has consistently delivered robust performance, emerging as a core profit engine for Amazon. Picks for you AI predicts Bitcoin price for year-end 5 hours ago Concerning: Unpaid credit card debt in US hits record $628 billion per month 5 hours ago Trading expert highlights 'last short' opportunity before the market changes 8 hours ago What USDT dominance is telling us about Bitcoin's price 11 hours ago Recent quarters show AWS revenue accelerating, reaching $26.3 billion in Q2, a year-over-year increase of 18.8%. With high demand for Amazon’s in-house AI processors, Trainium and Inferentia, AWS is gaining traction among businesses prioritizing cloud-driven AI solutions. This ongoing growth in AWS could be a significant stabilizing factor for Amazon’s Q3 earnings. Advertising gains and expansion Amazon’s advertising segment has become an increasingly profitable line of business, with over 20% year-over-year growth for multiple quarters. In Q2 alone, Amazon added $2 billion in advertising revenue, driving its annual total to a substantial $50 billion. Sponsored ads remain a cornerstone of this revenue stream, while the introduction of ads on Prime Video has broadened its reach within the digital advertising sector. The strategic use of AI in ad targeting and measurement tools enhances Amazon’s ad relevance, offering brands improved visibility. For Q3, analysts expect another strong performance in advertising, which could reinforce investor sentiment. Addressing retail sector headwinds Amazon’s core retail business, representing a large share of its revenue, has faced headwinds due to reduced consumer spending. Recent macroeconomic conditions and increasing competition from rivals like Shein and Temu have impacted the company’s sales forecasts and kept its stock performance in check. However, Amazon has responded by optimizing its logistics and delivery capabilities, expanding its same-day service, and regionalizing its fulfillment centers to boost efficiency and lower costs. The retail segment’s performance will be under scrutiny this quarter, as it represents Amazon’s largest revenue channel. While AWS and advertising provide strength, investors will be keen to see if Amazon’s operational improvements in retail lead to tangible gains in Q3. Project Kuiper: Amazon’s bold space venture Project Kuiper, Amazon’s satellite-based internet initiative, adds a unique dimension to its growth strategy. Targeting underserved regions, Kuiper aims to create a global satellite internet network. Despite high upfront costs, estimated between $16.5 billion and $20 billion, Kuiper represents Amazon’s venture into an untapped market. In the Q2 earnings call , Amazon noted a slight decrease in North America’s operating margin due to increased spending in areas such as Kuiper. This has spurred analyst debate about the impact on Amazon’s margins. Despite this, analysts see this as a long-term investment that could yield substantial revenue once Kuiper achieves scale.

Analysts maintain optimism Analysts have generally remained optimistic about Jeff Bezos’s company, as evidenced by its overall ‘strong buy’ rating across price target aggregate platforms. The average price target set by Wall Street researchers is around $224, while advanced AI models project prices of $225 and $200, respectively. The consensus indicates optimism about the company, making it a potential candidate for gains post-earnings. In summary, Amazon’s Q3 earnings will likely set the tone for its stock in the near term.

Aneena Alex Stocks Oct 26, 2024 Share As Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) prepares for its third-quarter earnings release on October 31, market expectations are rising. With Amazon’s stock price relatively flat over the past quarter at a current level of $187, investors are wondering if this upcoming report could serve as a catalyst for renewed momentum. While macroeconomic challenges are pressuring Amazon’s core retail business, its strengths in cloud computing and advertising remain focal points, likely playing a key role in its Q3 results and providing potential for a stock surge. Amazon six-month stock price. Source: Finbold AWS’s stronghold in the cloud market Amazon Web Services (AWS) has consistently delivered robust performance, emerging as a core profit engine for Amazon.

With high demand for Amazon’s in-house AI processors, Trainium and Inferentia, AWS is gaining traction among businesses prioritizing cloud-driven AI solutions. This ongoing growth in AWS could be a significant stabilizing factor for Amazon’s Q3 earnings. Advertising gains and expansion Amazon’s advertising segment has become an increasingly profitable line of business, with over 20% year-over-year growth for multiple quarters. In Q2 alone, Amazon added $2 billion in advertising revenue, driving its annual total to a substantial $50 billion. Sponsored ads remain a cornerstone of this revenue stream, while the introduction of ads on Prime Video has broadened its reach within the digital advertising sector. The strategic use of AI in ad targeting and measurement tools enhances Amazon’s ad relevance, offering brands improved visibility. For Q3, analysts expect another strong performance in advertising, which could reinforce investor sentiment. Addressing retail sector headwinds Amazon’s core retail business, representing a large share of its revenue, has faced headwinds due to reduced consumer spending. Recent macroeconomic conditions and increasing competition from rivals like Shein and Temu have impacted the company’s sales forecasts and kept its stock performance in check. However, Amazon has responded by optimizing its logistics and delivery capabilities, expanding its same-day service, and regionalizing its fulfillment centers to boost efficiency and lower costs. The retail segment’s performance will be under scrutiny this quarter, as it represents Amazon’s largest revenue channel. While AWS and advertising provide strength, investors will be keen to see if Amazon’s operational improvements in retail lead to tangible gains in Q3. Project Kuiper: Amazon’s bold space venture Project Kuiper, Amazon’s satellite-based internet initiative, adds a unique dimension to its growth strategy. Targeting underserved regions, Kuiper aims to create a global satellite internet network. Despite high upfront costs, estimated between $16.5 billion and $20 billion, Kuiper represents Amazon’s venture into an untapped market. In the Q2 earnings call , Amazon noted a slight decrease in North America’s operating margin due to increased spending in areas such as Kuiper. This has spurred analyst debate about the impact on Amazon’s margins. Despite this, analysts see this as a long-term investment that could yield substantial revenue once Kuiper achieves scale.

We thank Tony for his many accomplishments at Amazon and especially for what he’s delivered to customers.” Hoggett joined Amazon in January 2022 after three years at Tesco, where he served as group chief operating officer and then group chief strategy and innovation officer, according to his LinkedIn profile. “My time at Amazon has been incredible, and I’m grateful to my colleagues for their support, guidance and friendship,” Hoggett wrote in his post on LinkedIn. “I’m optimistic about the work Amazon is doing to improve the grocery shopping experience for customers, and have no doubt the teams will keep the momentum going in my absence.” Amazon has been looking to grow its presence in grocery — the one retail category in which it trails behind competitor Walmart by a wide margin, PYMNTS reported in September.

Coli situation when McDonald\'s reports Tuesday Mad Money with Jim Cramer With massive corporations including Alphabet , Meta , Apple , Microsoft and Amazon set to report earnings next week, CNBC\'s Jim Cramer on Friday urged investors to keep a level head. He also said not to forget about the nonfarm payroll report next Friday, where a weak hiring result could urge the Federal Reserve to keep cutting rates. "Huge opportunity," he said. "Just please remember, the first move\'s been the wrong move almost half the time since this earnings season began. Wait to process the numbers and listen to the conference calls before you pull the trigger." Monday starts off the week with earnings from Ford . Cramer said he wishes the automaker giant will report a clean quarter with no issues from warranty costs and not too much lost on electric vehicles. Tuesday brings McDonald\'s earnings report, and Cramer said to expect "a full airing of the e-coli situation," but that it is too early to tell how much damage it will do to the fast food chain. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday that a deadly E. coli outbreak linked to McDonald\'s Quarter Pounders has led to 75 cases in 13 states. Cramer predicts Royal Caribbean , Reddit and PayPal to all report a large beat and raise in year-end guidance. Alphabet will report after the close on Tuesday. While the tech behemoth\'s stock has been all over the map, Cramer said it has been "rarely in a good way." He said Alphabet is a great company, but not a solid stock as the leadership doesn\'t seem to prioritize what investors want to hear. Cramer said he believes Advanced Micro Devices will do well enough to take parts of Nvidia\'s business. Chipotle will report its earnings for the first time since former-CEO Brian Niccol\'s left the helm to run Starbucks , and Cramer said he believes announcing a permanent CEO would help the stock. Another large slate of reports are set for Wednesday, including Caterpillar and Eli Lilly . Cramer said he saw the former\'s machines all over Chevron\'s floating platform in the Gulf of Mexico, but isn\'t sure whether the likely strong report will be enough to move the already hot stock. The latter has had a strong run on the back of the GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, and Cramer said a Stifel report on the negative impact weight-loss drugs may have on food stock means Eli Lilly stocks will benefit. Meta and Microsoft will dominate the after-the-bell reports, and while Cramer said he believes Meta can continue its phenomenal quarterly run, he isn\'t too sure whether Microsoft will be able to convince investors that its AI-tool Copilot is as strong as advertised. Two more companies Cramer said will likely show a hot quarter, Booking Holding and DoorDash , will shed more light on consumers prior to the nonfarm payroll report. The monster week for earnings will continue into Thursday, as both Apple and Amazon will report after the bell. Even after the lackluster iPhone 16 launch , Cramer said " we\'ve seen this movie before " with the company and the best strategy is to hold on. Another moment not to panic, he said Amazon is doing well and not to dogpile on the potential hammering the stock received last quarter. Cramer said he believes two drug stocks, Merck and Bristol-Myers , are too low, but if Friday brings a weak employment number then they are two stocks investors should not have bought. On Friday, the nonfarm payroll report will be released, and Cramer said he "can\'t stress how important this number is ." He said continued strong employment will mean no November interest rate cut, and even though some investors will want to sell, fed rate cut cycles are times to buy. Oil titans Chevron and Exxon will report the same day. Cramer said he was impressed on his trip by the way Chevron\'s returned a huge amount of capital in dividends and buybacks even though it is still the worst performer in the group. He also said Exxon is more loved than Chevron from the battle over the Hess acquisition , even as Exxon doesn\'t have as much earnings power, and suggested people should switch sides. watch now VIDEO 10:39 10:39 Jim Cramer looks ahead to next week\'s market gameplan Mad Money with Jim Cramer Jim Cramer\'s Guide to Investing Click here to download Jim Cramer\'s Guide to Investing at no cost to help you build long-term wealth and invest smarter.

While the tech behemoth\'s stock has been all over the map, Cramer said it has been "rarely in a good way." He said Alphabet is a great company, but not a solid stock as the leadership doesn\'t seem to prioritize what investors want to hear. Cramer said he believes Advanced Micro Devices will do well enough to take parts of Nvidia\'s business. Chipotle will report its earnings for the first time since former-CEO Brian Niccol\'s left the helm to run Starbucks , and Cramer said he believes announcing a permanent CEO would help the stock. Another large slate of reports are set for Wednesday, including Caterpillar and Eli Lilly . Cramer said he saw the former\'s machines all over Chevron\'s floating platform in the Gulf of Mexico, but isn\'t sure whether the likely strong report will be enough to move the already hot stock. The latter has had a strong run on the back of the GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, and Cramer said a Stifel report on the negative impact weight-loss drugs may have on food stock means Eli Lilly stocks will benefit. Meta and Microsoft will dominate the after-the-bell reports, and while Cramer said he believes Meta can continue its phenomenal quarterly run, he isn\'t too sure whether Microsoft will be able to convince investors that its AI-tool Copilot is as strong as advertised. Two more companies Cramer said will likely show a hot quarter, Booking Holding and DoorDash , will shed more light on consumers prior to the nonfarm payroll report. The monster week for earnings will continue into Thursday, as both Apple and Amazon will report after the bell. Even after the lackluster iPhone 16 launch , Cramer said " we\'ve seen this movie before " with the company and the best strategy is to hold on. Another moment not to panic, he said Amazon is doing well and not to dogpile on the potential hammering the stock received last quarter. Cramer said he believes two drug stocks, Merck and Bristol-Myers , are too low, but if Friday brings a weak employment number then they are two stocks investors should not have bought. On Friday, the nonfarm payroll report will be released, and Cramer said he "can\'t stress how important this number is ." He said continued strong employment will mean no November interest rate cut, and even though some investors will want to sell, fed rate cut cycles are times to buy. Oil titans Chevron and Exxon will report the same day. Cramer said he was impressed on his trip by the way Chevron\'s returned a huge amount of capital in dividends and buybacks even though it is still the worst performer in the group. He also said Exxon is more loved than Chevron from the battle over the Hess acquisition , even as Exxon doesn\'t have as much earnings power, and suggested people should switch sides. watch now VIDEO 10:39 10:39 Jim Cramer looks ahead to next week\'s market gameplan Mad Money with Jim Cramer Jim Cramer\'s Guide to Investing Click here to download Jim Cramer\'s Guide to Investing at no cost to help you build long-term wealth and invest smarter.

The $180 level has been both resistance and support for shares of Amazon (AMZN). Almost any stock chart can illustrate important market dynamics. Some things are obvious. For example, stocks that are overbought or oversold tend to reverse. Another example is how they can reverse when they reach important price levels. This can be seen on the chart of Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN . This is why it is the Stock of the Day . The $180 level has been important for Amazon stock. There have been major reversals in the trend when it reached this level going back to July. In early October, $180 was a support level. This isn't a coincidence. The level was support because it was resistance in late August and early September. Resistance converting into support is a common occurrence in the financial markets. It is due to seller's remorse. Some of the investors and traders who sold Amazon close to $180 thought they made a good decision when the price traded lower soon after. But then the shares ripped through this resistance and moved higher. When this happened, some of the traders and investors who sold at resistance decided they had made a mistake by selling. Many of them wanted to buy their shares back, but will only do so if they could get them for the same prices they were sold at.

This large concentration of these orders created support at the same price where ther had been resistance. There is also a reason why there was resistance around $180. It isn't a coincidence either. There was resistance there because it had been a support level. Support converting into resistance is also a common occurrence in the stock market. This happens because of buyer's remorse. Some of the investors and traders who bought shares of Amazon in July thought they did the right thing when the stock moved higher soon after. But when the support broke and the price dropped below it, many of these previously happy buyers came to think they made a mistake. They decided to sell — if they can do so without losing money. As a result, when Amazon rallied back to $180, they placed sell orders. There were so many of these orders, it caused resistance to form at the price that had previously been support. One thing that is obvious when looking at a stock chart is how some price levels can be more important than others. The $180 level for Amazon is one of them.
